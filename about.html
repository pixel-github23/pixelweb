		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p>Hi. My name is Aryan. I am 17 years old and a student at Amrita Sanskrit higher Secondary School.
		<p>From a very early age, I was very interested in computers and electronics. In high school, I was introduced to a visual programming language called scratch, which allowed people to use blocks for giving instructions to a computer.</p>
		<p>So as always I was very interested in it, and i tried to make a couple of games here and there, but only one of them was good enough, that I could call it 'famous'. To this day it is one of my most popular games in scratch with about 11 views and 6 comments.
		I know it might not sound like much, but it was a huge milestone for me at the time.</p>
		<p>I wanted to make myself more poular as a game developer, not only in scratch, but also other media as well.
		<p>That's how this website was made; and you're looking at it.</p>
